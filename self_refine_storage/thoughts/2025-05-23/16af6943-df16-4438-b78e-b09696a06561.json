  "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines,\n        particularly computer systems. Machine learning, a crucial subset of AI, enables computers\n        to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.\n\n        Deep learning, using neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved remarkable breakthroughs\n        in natural language processing and computer vision. For example, AI systems now power\n        autonomous vehicles that can navigate complex traffic scenarios, medical diagnosis tools\n        that can detect diseases with high accuracy, and recommendation systems that personalize\n        user experiences across digital platforms.\n\n        However, ethical considerations around bias, fairness, and transparency remain critical\n        challenges that the AI community must address to ensure responsible development and deployment.",

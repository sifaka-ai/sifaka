# Sifaka Migration Status

This document tracks the status of the Sifaka refactoring project to implement the Thought container, make retrievers available to both models and critics, and add persistence mechanisms.


## Important context
/Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka/_sifaka will be deleted. We're migrating the useful parts of it to /Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka/

## Project Overview

We're creating a clean rewrite of Sifaka (moved to /Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka/_sifaka) in a new directory structure (/Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka/sifaka), focusing on:
1. Implementing a central state container (`Thought`)
2. Making retrievers available to both models and critics
3. Rewriting the Model interface to use Thoughts directly
4. Implementing persistence mechanisms (JSON, Redis, Milvus, Elasticsearch)

## Next Steps

1. Migrate validators, classifiers, and critics from the existing codebase
2. Adapt migrated components to use the Thought container
3. Implement Redis persistence provider
4. Implement Milvus persistence provider
5. Implement Elasticsearch persistence provider
6. Create more comprehensive examples
7. Write unit tests for all components

## Open Questions

- Should we maintain any backward compatibility?
- How should we version the new implementation?
- Should we support migration of existing data?
- What should be our testing strategy during development?

# Sifaka Codebase Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the next phase of Sifaka codebase improvements, focusing on the refactoring of large files into modular directory structures.

## Current Progress

Based on the IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_PROGRESS.md file, the following tasks have been completed:

1. Refactored `utils/config.py` into a modular directory structure
2. Created comprehensive documentation templates
3. Implemented standardized documentation across new modules
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
5. Configured code quality tools
6. Implemented code coverage reporting
7. Fixed configuration compatibility issues
8. Fixed SimpleRetriever to properly respect max_results parameter
9. Updated Ruff configuration to use line length of 100

## Next Steps

The next steps in the improvement plan focus on continuing the file structure refactoring, specifically:

1. Refactoring `utils/errors.py` (1,444 lines)
2. Refactoring `core/dependency.py` (1,299 lines)
3. Updating imports throughout the codebase
4. Implementing tests for the refactored modules

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Refactor `utils/errors.py` (Week 1)

Detailed plan available in [ERROR_REFACTORING_PLAN.md](ERROR_REFACTORING_PLAN.md).

#### Day 1-2: Setup and Base Implementation
1. Create directory structure
2. Implement `base.py` and `component.py`
3. Create initial tests

#### Day 3-4: Core Functionality
1. Implement `handling.py` and `results.py`
2. Implement `safe_execution.py`
3. Update tests

#### Day 5: Finalization
1. Implement `logging.py`
2. Implement `__init__.py`
3. Complete tests
4. Update imports in a few key files

### Phase 2: Refactor `core/dependency.py` (Week 2)

Detailed plan available in [DEPENDENCY_REFACTORING_PLAN.md](DEPENDENCY_REFACTORING_PLAN.md).

#### Day 1-2: Setup and Base Implementation
1. Create directory structure
2. Implement `provider.py`
3. Create initial tests

#### Day 3-4: Core Functionality
1. Implement `scopes.py` and `injector.py`
2. Implement `utils.py`
3. Update tests

#### Day 5: Finalization
1. Implement `__init__.py`
2. Complete tests
3. Update imports in a few key files

### Phase 3: Update Imports and Testing (Week 3)

#### Day 1-3: Update Imports
1. Identify all files that import from `sifaka.utils.errors`
2. Update imports to use the new module structure
3. Identify all files that import from `sifaka.core.dependency`
4. Update imports to use the new module structure

#### Day 4-5: Testing and Documentation
1. Create comprehensive tests for all refactored modules
2. Update documentation to reflect the new structure
3. Run all tests to ensure functionality is preserved
4. Update IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_PROGRESS.md with the completed tasks

## Implementation Approach

### Code Organization

1. **Module Structure**: Each module will have a clear purpose and responsibility
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for all functionality
4. **No Backward Compatibility**: As specified in the requirements, no backward compatibility code will be included

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each module in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between modules
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
4. **Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage

### Documentation Strategy

1. **Module Docstrings**: Comprehensive overview of each module
2. **Class Docstrings**: Detailed description of each class
3. **Method Docstrings**: Clear documentation for each method
4. **Examples**: Usage examples for all public APIs

## Success Criteria

1. **File Size Reduction**: Each module should be less than 300 lines
2. **Improved Organization**: Related functionality should be grouped together
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: All modules and classes should have comprehensive docstrings
4. **Test Coverage**: All modules should have at least 80% test coverage
5. **No Backward Compatibility**: No backward compatibility code should be included

## Timeline

### Week 1: Refactor `utils/errors.py`
- **Day 1-2**: Setup and Base Implementation
- **Day 3-4**: Core Functionality
- **Day 5**: Finalization

### Week 2: Refactor `core/dependency.py`
- **Day 1-2**: Setup and Base Implementation
- **Day 3-4**: Core Functionality
- **Day 5**: Finalization

### Week 3: Update Imports and Testing
- **Day 1-3**: Update Imports
- **Day 4-5**: Testing and Documentation

## Next Steps After Completion

After completing these refactoring tasks, the next steps in the improvement plan will be:

1. **Continue with File Structure Refactoring**:
   - Identify other large files that need refactoring
   - Apply the same refactoring approach

2. **Documentation Standardization**:
   - Apply documentation templates to other components
   - Create basic end-to-end examples

3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Develop testing strategy for each component type
   - Implement basic tests for core components

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to refactoring the `utils/errors.py` and `core/dependency.py` files into modular directory structures. By following this plan, we will improve the maintainability, organization, and documentation of the Sifaka codebase, while ensuring that all functionality is preserved.

## Issues and Challenges

| Issue | Description | Status | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| | | | |

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Use Protocol classes for interfaces | Abstract base classes | Protocols are more flexible and allow for structural typing, making the framework more extensible |
| Builder pattern for Chain | Configuration objects | Builder pattern provides a more fluent and intuitive API for users |
| Functional validators/improvers | Class-based validators/improvers | Functional approach is simpler and more composable |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create initial project structure
2. ✅ Begin implementation of core components
3. ✅ Create initial examples
4. ✅ Implement OpenAI provider
5. ✅ Add configuration management
6. ✅ Write tests for OpenAI provider
7. ✅ Implement Anthropic provider
8. ✅ Implement Google Gemini provider
9. ✅ Create provider factory functions
10. Design Validator protocol
11. Implement core validation rules
12. Create validation pipeline

## Notes

- Regular progress updates will be added to this document
- Design decisions will be documented as they are made
- Challenges and their resolutions will be tracked to inform future development

## Latest Update (2023-05-23)

Phase 2 (Model Providers) has been completed with the following components:

- OpenAI model implementation with token counting
- Anthropic model implementation with token counting
- Google Gemini model implementation with token counting
- Model factory function for creating model instances
- Comprehensive test suite for all model providers

All tests are passing for the model providers. The implementation includes proper error handling, configuration management, and token counting for each provider. Next steps will focus on implementing the validation components, starting with the Validator protocol and core validation rules.

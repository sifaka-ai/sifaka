Create an explanation and a diagram explaining how all of the folders (rules, critics, classifiers, adapters, etc.) in the Sifaka work together. Be specific about how they relate to each other, and the chain. Save that explanation to a file.

Create an explanation and a list of each file in the sifaka package and what it does.

Yes, you can use Elasticsearch, Milvus, and Postgres as retrievers in the Sifaka library. Let me explain how this works conceptually:

Retrieval in Sifaka
Sifaka's retrieval component is designed with a flexible architecture that allows you to integrate various vector databases and search engines. The library uses an abstraction layer that makes it possible to swap different retrieval backends.

Current Support Status
Elasticsearch: Yes, Elasticsearch can be used as a retriever in Sifaka. Elasticsearch has strong text search capabilities and also supports vector search with the appropriate plugins.
Milvus: Yes, Milvus can be integrated as a retriever. Milvus is specifically designed for vector similarity search and is well-suited for embedding-based retrieval.
Postgres: Yes, PostgreSQL can be used as a retriever, especially with the pgvector extension which adds vector similarity search capabilities to Postgres.
How It Works
The retrieval component in Sifaka follows an implementation pattern where:

There's a base retriever interface/protocol
Specific implementations for different backends inherit from this base
Each implementation handles the specifics of connecting to and querying its respective database
You would typically:

Create a connection to your database (Elasticsearch, Milvus, or Postgres)
Configure the retriever with appropriate settings
Use it within your Sifaka chain or critic components
This is all part of Sifaka's modular design that allows you to use different components based on your specific needs without having to rewrite your entire application.

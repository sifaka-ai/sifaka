## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Read the codebase** - understand the ContextAwareMixin pattern
3. **Start small** - pick a beginner-friendly issue first
4. **Follow the 3-line rule** - new features should be usable with ‚â§3 lines of code

### Code Standards
```python
# Example: Adding a new context method to the mixin
class ContextAwareMixin:
    def _prepare_semantic_context(
        self,
        thought: Thought,
        similarity_threshold: float = 0.75,
        max_docs: int = 5
    ) -> str:
        """Prepare context using semantic similarity.
        
        Args:
            thought: The Thought container with retrieved context.
            similarity_threshold: Minimum similarity score to include document.
            max_docs: Maximum number of documents to include.
            
        Returns:
            A formatted context string with semantically relevant documents.
            
        Example:
            ```python
            # Usage in any critic or model
            context = self._prepare_semantic_context(thought)
            prompt = template.format(text=thought.text, context=context)
            ```
        """
        # Implementation here...
```

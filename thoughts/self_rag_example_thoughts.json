    "text": "I'll provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature rise:\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions and Temperature Rise:\n\n1. Causal Relationship\n- Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise\n- CO2 is the primary driver, accounting for about 76% of total greenhouse gas emissions\n- Current CO2 levels: ~420 parts per million (ppm), compared to ~280 ppm pre-industrial levels\n\n2. Main Sources of Emissions\n- Fossil fuel combustion (electricity, transportation, industry): 73% of global emissions\n- Agriculture and land use changes: 18%\n- Industrial processes: 5%\n- Waste management: 4%\n\n3. Emission Sectors Breakdown\n- Energy production: 35%\n- Transportation: 24%\n- Industry: 21%\n- Agriculture: 14%\n- Buildings: 6%\n\n4. Mitigation Solutions\na) Renewable Energy Transition\n- Solar and wind power\n- Geothermal energy\n- Hydroelectric power\n\nb) Energy Efficiency\n- Improved building insulation\n- Energy-efficient appliances\n- Smart grid technologies\n\nc) Transportation Strategies\n- Electric vehicles\n- Public transit expansion\n- Hydrogen fuel technologies\n\nd) Industrial Decarbonization\n- Carbon capture and storage\n- Process electrification\n- Circular economy approaches\n\n5. Potential Impact\n- Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires global net-zero emissions by 2050\n- Current pledges insufficient to meet Paris Agreement goals\n- Urgent, coordinated global action necessary\n\nKey Recommendations:\n- Accelerate renewable energy deployment\n- Implement carbon pricing\n- Invest in clean technology research\n- Promote sustainable land use practices\n\nBy comprehensively addressing emissions across sectors, we can mitigate temperature rise and potential climate catastrophe.",

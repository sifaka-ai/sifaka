# Test Coverage Documentation

This document provides an overview of test coverage for the Sifaka project and explains some of the special test cases.

## Summary of Recent Work

During this testing sprint, we focused on improving test coverage for several key modules in the critics subsystem:

1. **Module: critics/managers/response.py**
   - Enhanced the test coverage from 13% to 80%
   - Added comprehensive tests for edge cases including handling of nested markers, invalid inputs, and unusual formatting
   - Verified proper handling of critique parsing with various input formats

2. **Module: critics/services/critique.py**
   - Improved the test coverage from 39% to 100%
   - Created tests for all synchronous and asynchronous methods
   - Added tests for error handling and edge cases
   - Implemented proper mocking of external dependencies

3. **Module: critics/prompt.py**
   - Enhanced test coverage from 41% to 87%
   - Added tests for protocol implementation
   - Created dedicated test classes for testing asynchronous methods
   - Tested fallback behaviors and error handling

4. **Module: critics/managers/prompt.py**
   - Improved test coverage from 56% to 91%
   - Tested both the abstract base class and concrete implementations
   - Added tests for handling optional parameters like reflections

5. **Module: critics/managers/prompt_factories.py**
   - Achieved 100% test coverage from the previous 50%
   - Created tests for all prompt factory classes
   - Verified correct behavior for both basic and specialized prompt managers

These improvements have contributed to increasing the overall project test coverage from 38% to 48%, making the codebase more robust and less prone to regression issues.

## Recent Test Coverage Improvements

The team has been focused on improving test coverage, particularly for modules that previously had 0% or low coverage. Here are the key improvements:

| Module | Before | After | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| utils/validation.py | 20% | 100% | Comprehensive testing of all validation utility functions |
| monitoring.py | 34% | 98% | Added detailed tests covering monitoring functionality |
| critics/style.py | 9% | 90%* | Comprehensive tests via isolation techniques |
| models/mock.py | 0% | 90%* | Comprehensive tests via isolation techniques |
| critics/managers/response.py | 13% | 80% | Added extensive tests for edge cases |
| critics/services/critique.py | 39% | 100% | Comprehensive tests including async methods |
| critics/prompt.py | 41% | 87% | Added tests for protocol implementation and async methods |
| critics/managers/prompt.py | 56% | 91% | Added tests for abstract class and implementation |
| critics/managers/prompt_factories.py | 50% | 100% | Added comprehensive tests for prompt factory classes |

\* Note: These modules may show lower percentages in the combined coverage report due to isolation testing.

## Special Testing Techniques

### Isolation Testing

Some modules require special testing techniques due to compatibility issues with Pydantic v2 and LangChain. For these modules, we've implemented isolated test runners that:

1. Patch the import system to avoid problematic imports
2. Run the tests in a clean environment
3. Generate coverage data separately

The following modules are tested using isolation techniques:
- sifaka/critics/protocols.py
- sifaka/critics/reflexion.py
- sifaka/critics/style.py
- sifaka/models/mock.py
- sifaka/rules/formatting/whitespace.py

These modules may show 0% coverage in the combined report even though they have tests.

### Async Testing

For modules that include asynchronous functions, we use pytest-asyncio to properly test the async code paths. Examples include:
- critics/services/critique.py - Test coverage includes both synchronous and asynchronous methods

## Running Tests with Coverage

To run the tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python run_all_tests_with_coverage.py

# Run specific tests with coverage
python -m pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -v --cov=sifaka.path.to.module --cov-report=term
```

## Current Overall Coverage

The current overall test coverage for the project is 48% (up from 38% before the recent improvements). We continue to work on improving coverage for the remaining modules, with the following modules identified as the next targets:

1. critics/reflexion.py (0%*)
2. critics/managers/memory.py (48%)
3. critics/core.py (54%)
4. classifiers/* (various low coverage modules)

\* Note: This module has tests but they're run in isolation due to compatibility issues.

# Dependency Management Refinement Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on refining dependency management in the Sifaka codebase.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Analyzed Circular Dependencies**
   - Created a dependency analysis script to identify circular imports
   - Generated a comprehensive dependency analysis report
   - Identified 80 circular dependencies in the codebase
   - Prioritized circular dependencies to address

2. **Created Detailed Implementation Plans**
   - Created DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md with overall implementation plan
   - Created CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCIES_RESOLUTION.md with specific recommendations for resolving circular dependencies
   - Created DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_ENHANCEMENT.md with plan for enhancing dependency injection
   - Created FACTORY_FUNCTION_REFACTORING.md with plan for refactoring factory functions
   - Created COMPONENT_INITIALIZATION.md with plan for improving component initialization

3. **Documented Dependency Management Guidelines**
   - Created docs/dependency_management.md with comprehensive guidelines
   - Documented the dependency injection system
   - Provided examples of proper dependency usage
   - Created guidelines for adding new components

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Circular Dependencies Resolution**
   - Move interface definitions to dedicated interface modules
   - Use type hints with string literals for forward references
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Restructure imports to avoid circular dependencies

2. **Enhance Dependency Injection**
   - Update DependencyProvider implementation in core/dependency.py
   - Add support for scoped dependencies
   - Improve error handling and logging
   - Implement dependency resolution strategies

3. **Refactor Factory Functions**
   - Standardize parameter naming across factory functions
   - Implement dependency resolution in factory functions
   - Add validation for required dependencies
   - Use type annotations consistently

4. **Improve Component Initialization**
   - Update InitializableMixin in core/initialization.py
   - Implement proper resource management
   - Add validation for required dependencies
   - Use state management consistently

## Implementation Approach

The implementation should follow this approach:

1. **Start with Core Infrastructure**
   - Update core/dependency.py with enhanced DependencyProvider
   - Update core/initialization.py with improved InitializableMixin
   - Update core/factories.py with standardized factory functions

2. **Address Circular Dependencies**
   - Focus on the model component first
   - Then address configuration circular dependencies
   - Then address rules component circular dependencies
   - Finally address other circular dependencies

3. **Update Component Implementations**
   - Update model providers to use enhanced dependency injection
   - Update critics to use enhanced dependency injection
   - Update rules to use enhanced dependency injection
   - Update chain components to use enhanced dependency injection
   - Update retrieval components to use enhanced dependency injection
   - Update adapters to use enhanced dependency injection
   - Update classifiers to use enhanced dependency injection

4. **Add Tests**
   - Add tests for DependencyProvider
   - Add tests for factory functions
   - Add tests for component initialization
   - Add tests for dependency resolution

## Success Criteria

The dependency management refinement will be considered successful when:

1. No circular dependencies in the codebase
2. Consistent dependency injection patterns across all components
3. Improved error handling for missing dependencies
4. Comprehensive documentation for dependency management
5. All components use explicit dependency injection
6. Factory functions follow standardized patterns
7. Component initialization is standardized
8. Tests validate proper dependency injection

## Conclusion

The dependency management refinement plan provides a comprehensive approach to addressing circular dependencies and improving dependency injection in the Sifaka codebase. By following this plan, the codebase will become more maintainable, testable, and extensible.

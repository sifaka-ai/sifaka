# Sifaka Vision

## Mission

Sifaka is an open-source framework that adds reflection and reliability to large language model (LLM) applications. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and production-ready applications by providing researchers and practitioners with production-grade tools that implement academic breakthroughs as reliable, observable, and debuggable components.

We empower researchers to conduct rigorous experiments with industry-standard infrastructure while enabling practitioners to deploy cutting-edge techniques with confidence. By democratizing access to research-grade AI tools, Sifaka accelerates the translation of academic innovations into real-world impact.

## Core Philosophy

### Research-First Approach
We believe the future of AI applications lies in implementing proven academic research rather than ad-hoc solutions. Sifaka transforms research papers into production-ready components:

- **Reflexion** (Shinn et al. 2023) for self-reflective improvement
- **Self-Refine** (Madaan et al. 2023) - Iterative self-improvement through critique and revision
- **Self-RAG** (Asai et al. 2023) for retrieval-augmented critique
- **Constitutional AI** (Anthropic) for principle-based evaluation
- **Meta-Rewarding** (Wu et al. 2024) - Two-stage judgment with meta-evaluation
- **Self-Consistency** (Wang et al. 2022) - Multiple critique generation with consensus
- **N-Critics** (Mousavi et al. 2023) - Ensemble of specialized critics

### Graph-Based Workflow with Thought-Centric State
Traditional AI frameworks use linear chains or ad-hoc orchestration. Sifaka uses PydanticAI's graph-based workflow orchestration centered around the **SifakaThought** - a complete state container that flows through the graph:

- **Graph Orchestration**: Clear, resumable workflow execution with state persistence
- **Complete observability** of every step in the generation process through graph nodes
- **Immutable state management** with proper versioning and history at each iteration
- **Rich debugging capabilities** with exact prompts, intermediate results, and node transitions
- **Serializable audit trails** for analysis, compliance, and workflow resumption

### Validation-First Design with Graph Integration
Most frameworks treat validation as an afterthought. Sifaka makes validation and iterative improvement core concepts through dedicated graph nodes:

- **ValidateNode**: Built-in parallel validation at every iteration
- **CritiqueNode**: Parallel critic execution for quality improvement
- **Automatic iteration**: Graph flow control handles improvement cycles
- **Actionable feedback**: Critics provide specific suggestions, not just scores
- **Complete transparency**: Every validation and critique decision is captured in the thought audit trail

## Technical Vision

### PydanticAI Graph-Based Architecture
**As of Sifaka 0.4.0, we have fully adopted PydanticAI's graph-based workflow orchestration.** This represents a major architectural evolution that aligns us with PydanticAI's future:

- **Graph-based workflows** using PydanticAI's native graph orchestration
- **Node-based design** with separate Generate, Validate, and Critique nodes
- **State persistence** with built-in snapshotting and resumability
- **Parallel execution** of validators and critics within their respective nodes
- **Type-safe AI applications** with Pydantic's validation and serialization
- **Modern async patterns** built on PydanticAI's foundation
- **Aligned development roadmap** with PydanticAI's graph evolution

### MCP-First Architecture
We're building for the future of AI infrastructure using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

- **Standardized communication** with external services
- **Unified storage architecture** across Redis and other backends
- **Cross-process data sharing** for distributed applications
- **Future-proof integration** with emerging AI infrastructure

### Academic Rigor in Production
Sifaka bridges the gap between research and production by:

- Implementing papers with proper citations and academic rigor
- Providing configurable parameters that match research specifications
- Maintaining compatibility with research evaluation metrics
- Enabling reproducible experiments in production environments

### Complete Observability
Every aspect of the AI generation process should be observable and debuggable:

- **Thought containers** that track complete state evolution
- **Exact prompt logging** for debugging and analysis
- **Validation and critique history** for understanding failures
- **Performance metrics** for optimization and monitoring

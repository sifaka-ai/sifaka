# Sifaka Vision

## Mission

Sifaka is an open-source framework that adds reflection and reliability to large language model (LLM) applications. Our mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and production-ready applications by providing researchers and practitioners with production-grade tools that implement academic breakthroughs as reliable, observable, and debuggable components.

We empower researchers to conduct rigorous experiments with industry-standard infrastructure while enabling practitioners to deploy cutting-edge techniques with confidence. By democratizing access to research-grade AI tools, Sifaka accelerates the translation of academic innovations into real-world impact.

## Core Philosophy

### Research-First Approach
We believe the future of AI applications lies in implementing proven academic research rather than ad-hoc solutions. Sifaka transforms research papers into production-ready components:

- **Reflexion** (Shinn et al. 2023) for self-reflective improvement
- **Self-Refine** (Madaan et al. 2023) - Iterative self-improvement through critique and revision
- **Self-RAG** (Asai et al. 2023) for retrieval-augmented critique
- **Constitutional AI** (Anthropic) for principle-based evaluation
- **Meta-Rewarding** (Wu et al. 2024) - Two-stage judgment with meta-evaluation
- **Self-Consistency** (Wang et al. 2022) - Multiple critique generation with consensus
- **N-Critics** (Mousavi et al. 2023) - Ensemble of specialized critics

### Thought-Centric Architecture
Traditional AI frameworks focus on chains of tools. Sifaka centers everything around the **Thought** - a complete state container that provides:

- **Complete observability** of every step in the generation process
- **Immutable state management** with proper versioning and history
- **Rich debugging capabilities** with exact prompts and intermediate results
- **Serializable audit trails** for analysis and compliance

### Validation-First Design
Most frameworks treat validation as an afterthought. Sifaka makes validation and iterative improvement core concepts:

- Built-in validation at every step
- Automatic iterative improvement when validation fails
- Critics that provide actionable feedback, not just scores
- Complete transparency in the improvement process

## Technical Vision

### PydanticAI-First Architecture
**As of Sifaka 0.2.0, we are fully aligned with PydanticAI's development and vision.** PydanticAI represents the future of AI agent frameworks, and Sifaka will evolve alongside it:

- **Native PydanticAI integration** as our primary chain implementation
- **Tool-based extensibility** leveraging PydanticAI's powerful tool system
- **Type-safe AI applications** with Pydantic's validation and serialization
- **Modern async patterns** built on PydanticAI's foundation
- **Aligned development roadmap** with PydanticAI's evolution

### MCP-First Architecture
We're building for the future of AI infrastructure using the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

- **Standardized communication** with external services
- **Unified storage architecture** across Redis, Milvus, and other backends
- **Cross-process data sharing** for distributed applications
- **Future-proof integration** with emerging AI infrastructure

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status**: MCP storage integration is currently experiencing issues and is our highest priority to fix. We're actively working on restoring Redis and Milvus backends via MCP. For production use, we recommend Memory or File storage until MCP integration is restored.

### Academic Rigor in Production
Sifaka bridges the gap between research and production by:

- Implementing papers with proper citations and academic rigor
- Providing configurable parameters that match research specifications
- Maintaining compatibility with research evaluation metrics
- Enabling reproducible experiments in production environments

### Complete Observability
Every aspect of the AI generation process should be observable and debuggable:

- **Thought containers** that track complete state evolution
- **Exact prompt logging** for debugging and analysis
- **Validation and critique history** for understanding failures
- **Performance metrics** for optimization and monitoring

## Current Status (v0.3.0)

### Major Achievements
- **‚úÖ PydanticAI-Only Architecture**: Complete removal of Traditional Chain for simplified, focused codebase

## Implementation Quality Scores

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Documentation** | 9.5/10 | Excellent paper references, clear adaptations |
| **Code Quality** | 9/10 | Clean, well-structured, consistent patterns |
| **Paper Fidelity** | 7/10 | Good adaptations, some simplifications |
| **Practical Value** | 9/10 | High utility for text improvement |
| **Extensibility** | 10/10 | Excellent plugin architecture |
| **Performance** | 8/10 | Good, with room for optimization |
| **Testing** | 8/10 | Comprehensive unit and integration tests |

## Missing Features & Opportunities

1. **Self-RAG**: Needs actual retrieval integration
2. **All Critics**: Could benefit from performance benchmarks
3. **Documentation**: Task-specific examples for each critic
4. **Optimization**: Caching for Self-Consistency evaluations
5. **Metrics**: Standardized quality metrics across critics

## Conclusion

The Sifaka critics are **exceptionally well-documented** with strong research foundations. While some implementations simplify the original papers for practical use, this is a **good design choice** that makes them more accessible and useful for text improvement tasks. The addition of usage guidance and this comparison table addresses the main documentation gap identified.

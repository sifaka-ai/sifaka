# [Guide Title]

This guide explains how to [brief description of what the guide covers].

## Overview

[Provide a high-level overview of the topic, explaining its purpose and importance in the Sifaka ecosystem.]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [Prerequisite 1]
- [Prerequisite 2]
- [Prerequisite 3]

## Basic Concepts

### [Concept 1]

[Explain the first key concept, including its purpose and how it fits into the overall system.]

```python
# Example code demonstrating the concept
from sifaka.module import Component

component = Component(param="value")
result = component.method()
```

### [Concept 2]

[Explain the second key concept, including its purpose and how it fits into the overall system.]

```python
# Example code demonstrating the concept
from sifaka.module import AnotherComponent

component = AnotherComponent(param="value")
result = component.method()
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: [First Step]

[Detailed explanation of the first step.]

```python
# Code for the first step
from sifaka.module import Component

component = Component()
```

### Step 2: [Second Step]

[Detailed explanation of the second step.]

```python
# Code for the second step
result = component.method()
```

### Step 3: [Third Step]

[Detailed explanation of the third step.]

```python
# Code for the third step
processed_result = process(result)
```

## Common Patterns

### [Pattern 1]

[Explain a common pattern or best practice.]

```python
# Example of the pattern
from sifaka.module import Component

# Pattern implementation
def pattern_implementation():
    component = Component()
    return component.method()
```

### [Pattern 2]

[Explain another common pattern or best practice.]

```python
# Example of the pattern
from sifaka.module import Component

# Pattern implementation
class PatternImplementation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.component = Component()
        
    def execute(self):
        return self.component.method()
```

## Advanced Usage

### [Advanced Topic 1]

[Explain an advanced topic or technique.]

```python
# Advanced example
from sifaka.module import Component
from sifaka.advanced import AdvancedFeature

component = Component()
advanced = AdvancedFeature(component)
result = advanced.complex_operation()
```

### [Advanced Topic 2]

[Explain another advanced topic or technique.]

```python
# Another advanced example
from sifaka.module import Component
from sifaka.advanced import AnotherAdvancedFeature

component = Component()
advanced = AnotherAdvancedFeature(component)
result = advanced.another_complex_operation()
```

## Troubleshooting

### [Common Issue 1]

**Problem**: [Description of the problem]

**Solution**: [Steps to solve the problem]

```python
# Example fix
from sifaka.module import Component

# Correct way to use the component
component = Component(correct_param="value")
```

### [Common Issue 2]

**Problem**: [Description of the problem]

**Solution**: [Steps to solve the problem]

```python
# Example fix
from sifaka.module import Component

# Correct way to handle errors
try:
    component = Component()
    result = component.method()
except ComponentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Handle the error
```

## Next Steps

1. **Model Components**: Start with standardizing docstrings in model components
2. **Critic Components**: Then move to critic components
3. **Rule Components**: Continue with rule components
4. **Classifier Components**: Then standardize classifier components
5. **Retrieval Components**: Move to retrieval components
6. **Adapter Components**: Finally standardize adapter components

## Guidelines

When updating docstrings, follow these guidelines:

1. **Follow Templates**: Use the templates in `docs/docstring_standardization.md`
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all relevant sections
3. **Add Examples**: Include usage examples for all components
4. **Document Exceptions**: Document all exceptions that can be raised
5. **Update Tracking**: Update this document as components are completed

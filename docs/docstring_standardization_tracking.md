# Docstring Standardization Tracking

This document tracks the progress of standardizing docstrings across the Sifaka codebase according to the templates defined in `docs/docstring_standardization.md`.

## Overview

The docstring standardization effort focuses on ensuring all modules, classes, and methods in the Sifaka codebase have comprehensive, standardized docstrings that follow the templates defined in `docs/docstring_standardization.md`.

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Core Components**: Focus on standardizing docstrings in core components first
2. **Move to Utility Modules**: Then standardize utility modules that are used across the codebase
3. **Standardize Chain Components**: Focus on chain components that are central to the system
4. **Complete Remaining Components**: Standardize docstrings in all remaining components

## Guidelines

When updating docstrings, follow these guidelines:

1. **Follow Templates**: Use the templates in `docs/docstring_standardization.md`
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Include all relevant sections
3. **Add Examples**: Include usage examples for all components
4. **Document Exceptions**: Document all exceptions that can be raised
5. **Update Tracking**: Update this document as components are completed

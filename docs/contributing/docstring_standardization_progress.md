### sifaka/rules/formatting/length.py

The following components in `sifaka/rules/formatting/length.py` have been updated to follow the standardized docstring format:

1. **Module Docstring**
   - Added clear description of module purpose
   - Listed key components provided by the module
   - Added lifecycle information

5. **Factory Functions**
   - `create_length_validator`: Added detailed parameter descriptions and expanded examples
   - `create_length_rule`: Added detailed parameter descriptions and expanded examples

## Standardization Patterns Applied

1. **Consistent Structure**
   - All docstrings follow the Google-style format
   - All component docstrings include a clear description, lifecycle information, and examples
   - All examples include imports and are runnable

2. **Lifecycle Information**
   - All components include a "Lifecycle" section that explains the component's lifecycle
   - Lifecycle sections use consistent formatting with numbered steps
   - Each lifecycle step includes bullet points with details

3. **Examples**
   - All examples include imports
   - Examples show both simple and complex usage patterns
   - Examples include error handling where appropriate

4. **Attributes**
   - Class docstrings include an "Attributes" section that describes class attributes
   - Attribute descriptions are clear and concise
   - Private attributes are included where relevant

5. **Type Annotations**
   - All parameters and return values have type annotations
   - Generic types are used consistently
   - Type variables are documented

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Core Module Standardization**
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/critics/base.py`
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/chain/core.py`
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/models/base.py`

2. **Expand to Rule Modules**
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/rules/formatting/style.py`
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/rules/content/prohibited.py`
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/rules/factual/accuracy.py`
   - Update docstrings in `sifaka/rules/domain/legal.py`

3. **Expand to Classifier Modules**
   - Update docstrings in specialized classifier implementations
   - Update docstrings in classifier utility modules
   - Ensure consistency with base module patterns

4. **Review and Refine**
   - Review standardized docstrings for consistency
   - Ensure all examples are runnable
   - Check for any missing information
   - Verify cross-references between modules

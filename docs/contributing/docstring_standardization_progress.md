## Standardization Patterns Applied

1. **Consistent Structure**
   - All docstrings follow the Google-style format
   - All component docstrings include a clear description, lifecycle information, and examples
   - All examples include imports and are runnable

2. **Lifecycle Information**
   - All components include a "Lifecycle" section that explains the component's lifecycle
   - Lifecycle sections use consistent formatting with numbered steps
   - Each lifecycle step includes bullet points with details

3. **Examples**
   - All examples include imports
   - Examples show both simple and complex usage patterns
   - Examples include error handling where appropriate

4. **Attributes**
   - Class docstrings include an "Attributes" section that describes class attributes
   - Attribute descriptions are clear and concise
   - Private attributes are included where relevant

5. **Type Annotations**
   - All parameters and return values have type annotations
   - Generic types are used consistently
   - Type variables are documented

## Next Steps

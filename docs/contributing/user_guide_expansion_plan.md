# User Guide Expansion Plan

This document outlines the plan for expanding Sifaka's user guides to make the framework more accessible and easier to use.

## Current State

Sifaka currently has some basic documentation, but lacks comprehensive user guides for many components and use cases. This plan aims to address these gaps.

## Goals

1. Create a complete set of user guides covering all major components
2. Develop task-oriented guides for common use cases
3. Provide conceptual guides explaining key patterns and principles
4. Ensure all guides follow consistent standards
5. Make guides accessible to users with different levels of experience

## Guide Template

All guides should follow the [User Guide Template](../templates/user_guide_template.md) and adhere to the [User Guide Standards](./user_guide_standards.md).

## Review Process

Each guide should be reviewed for:
1. Technical accuracy
2. Completeness
3. Clarity
4. Consistency with standards
5. Quality of examples

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked in this document by marking completed guides with [x].

## Prioritization Criteria

Guides are prioritized based on:
1. User impact (how many users will benefit)
2. Complexity (how difficult the topic is to understand)
3. Dependency (whether other guides depend on it)
4. Current documentation gaps

## Next Steps

1. Create the Quick Start Guide
2. Create the Basic Concepts Guide
3. Create the Rules Guide
4. Review and refine the guide template based on initial guides
5. Continue with Phase 1 guides

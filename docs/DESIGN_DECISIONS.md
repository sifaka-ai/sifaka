# Sifaka Design Decisions

This document captures the key architectural and design decisions made in Sifaka, along with the rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs involved.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decisions

### **Decision 1: PydanticAI-Only Architecture (v0.3.0)**

**Decision**: Remove Traditional Chain completely and adopt PydanticAI-only architecture.

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Single chain implementation reduces complexity and maintenance burden
- **Modern Patterns**: PydanticAI represents the future of AI agent frameworks

- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic integration ensures type safety throughout the system
- **Community Alignment**: Aligns with PydanticAI's development and ecosystem

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Dual Architecture**: Maintain both Traditional and PydanticAI chains
   - *Rejected*: Increased complexity, maintenance burden, and user confusion
2. **Gradual Migration**: Slowly deprecate Traditional Chain over multiple versions
   - *Rejected*: Prolonged complexity and unclear migration path
3. **Traditional Chain as Primary**: Keep Traditional Chain as the main implementation
   - *Rejected*: Would miss benefits of modern agent patterns and tool calling

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Simplified codebase, modern patterns, better extensibility, type safety
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Breaking change for existing users, temporary loss of some features during transition

**Impact**: Major breaking change requiring user migration, but provides cleaner foundation for future development.

### **Decision 2: Thought-First Architecture**

**Decision**: Center the entire system around the Thought container as the primary state management mechanism.

**Rationale**:
- **Complete Observability**: Every step of the AI generation process is captured and traceable

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Chain-Centric Architecture**: Focus on chain operations with minimal state tracking
   - *Rejected*: Poor observability and debugging capabilities
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events to track system state changes
   - *Rejected*: More complex to implement and reason about
3. **Database-Centric**: Store all state in external database
   - *Rejected*: Performance overhead and external dependencies

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Complete observability, excellent debugging, audit trails, research alignment
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Memory overhead for complex workflows, serialization complexity

**Impact**: Enables unprecedented observability and debugging capabilities for AI text generation.

### **Decision 3: Feedback Integration in Agent Prompts**

**Decision**: Pass validation results and critic feedback directly to PydanticAI agents in subsequent iterations.

**Rationale**:
- **Iterative Improvement**: Agents can learn from previous failures and feedback
- **Context Preservation**: Complete context is available for improvement decisions
- **Research Fidelity**: Matches academic research on iterative AI improvement
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of how feedback influences generation

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **External Feedback Processing**: Process feedback outside the agent
   - *Rejected*: Loses context and reduces improvement effectiveness
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Modify agent behavior without explicit feedback
   - *Rejected*: Reduces transparency and debugging capabilities
3. **Separate Improvement Agent**: Use a dedicated agent for improvements
   - *Rejected*: Adds complexity and potential context loss

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Effective iterative improvement, transparency, research alignment
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Longer prompts, potential context window limitations

**Impact**: Enables effective iterative improvement while maintaining complete transparency.

### **Decision 4: Guaranteed Completion Pattern**

**Decision**: Always return a final Thought, either from successful validation or after reaching maximum iterations.

**Rationale**:
- **Reliability**: Users always get a result, even if not perfect
- **Production Readiness**: Systems can handle edge cases gracefully
- **Debugging**: Failed attempts are preserved for analysis
- **User Experience**: Predictable behavior reduces user frustration

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Exception on Failure**: Throw exceptions when validation fails
   - *Rejected*: Poor user experience and production reliability
2. **Optional Results**: Return None or Optional types for failures
   - *Rejected*: Complicates user code and error handling
3. **Infinite Retries**: Continue until validation passes
   - *Rejected*: Risk of infinite loops and resource exhaustion

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Reliable behavior, graceful degradation, better debugging
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Users must check validation status, potential for low-quality outputs

**Impact**: Provides reliable, production-ready behavior while preserving debugging information.

## üîß Implementation Decisions

### **Decision 5: Async-First Design**

**Decision**: Use async/await patterns throughout the system by default.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Better concurrency for I/O-bound operations (API calls, storage)
- **PydanticAI Alignment**: PydanticAI is async-first
- **Scalability**: Supports high-throughput production environments
- **Modern Patterns**: Aligns with modern Python async ecosystem

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Sync-First with Async Wrappers**: Synchronous core with async wrappers
   - *Rejected*: Performance overhead and complexity
2. **Mixed Sync/Async**: Some components sync, others async
   - *Rejected*: Inconsistent patterns and integration complexity
3. **Sync-Only**: Purely synchronous implementation
   - *Rejected*: Poor performance for I/O-bound operations

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Better performance, modern patterns, PydanticAI alignment
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Learning curve for sync-focused developers, async complexity

**Impact**: Enables high-performance, scalable applications with modern async patterns.

### **Decision 6: Composition Over Inheritance**

**Decision**: Use composition patterns rather than inheritance for PydanticAI integration.

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Easier to modify and extend behavior
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clearer dependencies and relationships
- **PydanticAI Compatibility**: Avoids conflicts with PydanticAI's internal structure

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Inheritance from PydanticAI Classes**: Extend PydanticAI Agent directly
   - *Rejected*: Tight coupling and potential conflicts with PydanticAI updates
2. **Mixin Patterns**: Use mixins to add Sifaka functionality
   - *Rejected*: Complex inheritance hierarchies and potential conflicts
3. **Monkey Patching**: Modify PydanticAI classes at runtime
   - *Rejected*: Fragile and difficult to maintain

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Flexibility, testability, maintainability, compatibility

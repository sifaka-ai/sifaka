# Sifaka Design Decisions

This document captures the key architectural and design decisions made in Sifaka, along with the rationale, alternatives considered, and trade-offs involved.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Decisions

### **Decision 1: PydanticAI Graph-Based Architecture (v0.4.0)**

**Decision**: Adopt PydanticAI's graph-based workflow orchestration as the core architecture, replacing chain-based approaches.

**Rationale**:
- **Graph Orchestration**: PydanticAI graphs provide clear, resumable workflow execution with state persistence
- **Node-Based Design**: Separate nodes for Generate, Validate, and Critique operations enable better separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Built-in state persistence and snapshotting for resumable workflows
- **Parallel Execution**: Validators and critics can run concurrently within their respective nodes
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic integration with structured state containers (`SifakaThought`)
- **Modern Patterns**: Aligns with PydanticAI's evolution toward graph-based agent workflows

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Chain-Based Architecture**: Continue with sequential chain execution
   - *Rejected*: Less flexible, no built-in state persistence, harder to resume workflows
2. **Custom Workflow Engine**: Build our own workflow orchestration
   - *Rejected*: Reinventing the wheel, maintenance burden, less integration with PydanticAI
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use event streams for workflow coordination
   - *Rejected*: More complex, harder to debug, less alignment with PydanticAI patterns

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Better workflow control, state persistence, parallel execution, resumable workflows
- ‚ùå **Cons**: More complex setup, requires understanding of graph concepts, breaking API changes

**Impact**: Enables sophisticated workflow orchestration with state persistence and resumability, setting foundation for advanced features.

### **Decision 2: SifakaThought as Central State Container**

**Decision**: Use `SifakaThought` as the central state container that flows through the entire graph workflow, capturing complete audit trails.

**Rationale**:
- **Complete Observability**: Every generation, validation, critique, and tool call is captured with full context
- **Immutable History**: Each iteration preserves complete history while allowing state updates during processing
- **Graph Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with PydanticAI's graph state management
- **Debugging Excellence**: Exact prompts, responses, feedback, and decision points are preserved
- **Serialization**: Complete state can be persisted and restored for analysis and compliance
- **Research Alignment**: Matches academic research patterns for AI system evaluation and reproducibility

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Separate State Objects**: Different state objects for each node type
   - *Rejected*: Fragmented state, complex data flow, loss of complete audit trail
2. **Event Sourcing**: Track state changes as events
   - *Rejected*: More complex to implement, harder to query current state
3. **External State Store**: Store state in external database during execution
   - *Rejected*: Performance overhead, network dependencies, complexity

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Complete observability, excellent debugging, audit trails, graph integration
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Memory overhead for complex workflows, large serialized objects

**Impact**: Enables unprecedented observability and debugging capabilities while integrating seamlessly with PydanticAI graphs.

### **Decision 3: Context-Aware Generation with Feedback Integration**

**Decision**: Build rich context from validation results and critic feedback in the GenerateNode for subsequent iterations.

**Rationale**:
- **Iterative Improvement**: Agents receive specific feedback about what failed and how to improve
- **Context Preservation**: Complete history of previous attempts and feedback is available
- **Research Fidelity**: Matches academic research on iterative AI improvement (Reflexion, Self-Refine)
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of how feedback influences generation
- **Graph Integration**: Context building happens within the graph workflow naturally

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **External Feedback Processing**: Process feedback outside the graph workflow
   - *Rejected*: Loses integration with graph state, reduces improvement effectiveness
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Modify agent behavior without explicit feedback context
   - *Rejected*: Reduces transparency and debugging capabilities
3. **Separate Improvement Node**: Use a dedicated node for processing improvements
   - *Rejected*: Adds complexity, breaks natural generation flow

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Effective iterative improvement, transparency, research alignment, graph integration
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Longer prompts, potential context window limitations, complex context building

**Impact**: Enables effective iterative improvement while maintaining complete transparency and graph workflow integration.

### **Decision 4: Guaranteed Completion with Graph Termination**

**Decision**: Always return a final `SifakaThought` through proper graph termination, either from successful validation/critique or after reaching maximum iterations.

**Rationale**:
- **Reliability**: Users always get a result, even if not perfect
- **Production Readiness**: Systems can handle edge cases gracefully through graph flow control
- **Debugging**: Failed attempts are preserved in the thought's complete audit trail
- **User Experience**: Predictable behavior reduces user frustration
- **Graph Integration**: Natural termination through `End` nodes maintains graph workflow integrity

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Exception on Failure**: Throw exceptions when validation fails
   - *Rejected*: Poor user experience, breaks graph workflow, production reliability issues
2. **Optional Results**: Return None or Optional types for failures
   - *Rejected*: Complicates user code, doesn't align with graph patterns
3. **Infinite Retries**: Continue until validation passes
   - *Rejected*: Risk of infinite loops, resource exhaustion, poor graph termination

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Reliable behavior, graceful degradation, better debugging, graph workflow integrity
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Users must check validation status, potential for low-quality outputs

**Impact**: Provides reliable, production-ready behavior while preserving debugging information and maintaining proper graph workflow patterns.

### **Decision 5: Parallel Execution within Nodes**

**Decision**: Execute all validators in parallel within ValidateNode and all critics in parallel within CritiqueNode.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Concurrent execution reduces total processing time for multiple validators/critics
- **Independence**: Validators and critics are designed to be independent and can run concurrently
- **Scalability**: Better resource utilization for I/O-bound operations (API calls)
- **Graph Efficiency**: Maximizes throughput within each node while maintaining clear workflow structure

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Sequential Execution**: Run validators and critics one after another
   - *Rejected*: Poor performance, unnecessary waiting for independent operations
2. **Cross-Node Parallelism**: Run validation and critique in parallel
   - *Rejected*: Breaks logical workflow (critique should happen after validation passes)
3. **User-Configurable**: Allow users to choose parallel vs sequential
   - *Rejected*: Adds complexity without significant benefit

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Better performance, efficient resource usage, maintains workflow logic
- ‚ùå **Cons**: More complex error handling, potential resource contention

**Impact**: Significantly improves performance for workflows with multiple validators or critics while maintaining clear execution semantics.

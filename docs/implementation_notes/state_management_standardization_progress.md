# State Management Standardization Progress

This document tracks the progress of standardizing state management across the Sifaka codebase.

## Target Pattern

All components should use the standardized StateManager pattern:

```python
# State management
_state_manager = PrivateAttr(default_factory=create_X_state)

# Accessing state
state = self._state_manager.get_state()
```

## Next Steps

1. Verify tests to ensure they're compatible with the standardized state management pattern
2. Update documentation to reflect the standardized state management pattern
3. Consider adding more examples of the standardized state management pattern

## Completion Checklist

- [x] All classifiers standardized
- [x] All critics standardized
- [x] All rules standardized
- [x] All chains standardized
- [x] All models standardized
- [x] All adapters standardized
- [ ] Tests updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Conclusion

All components in the Sifaka codebase are now using the standardized StateManager pattern with `_state_manager` and `state = self._state_manager.get_state()`. This ensures consistent state management across the codebase and makes it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

The standardization process was simpler than expected because most components were already using the standardized pattern. This is a testament to the good design practices that have been followed in the Sifaka codebase.

Next steps would be to ensure that all tests are compatible with the standardized pattern and to update documentation to reflect the standardized pattern.

# Sifaka Tests Status

## Current Progress

Update tests to use the latest Pydantic v2 API

We've been working on fixing the tests in the Sifaka project. Here's the current status:

### Fixed Issues
1. Fixed the `MockTokenCounter` class in `tests/utils/mock_provider.py` to match the implementation in the actual codebase
2. Fixed the `MockProvider` class to use the correct parameter for the `MockTokenCounter`
3. Fixed the `MockValidator` and `MockImprover` classes in `tests/chain/test_chain.py` to implement the required properties from the `ChainComponent` interface
4. Fixed the `Chain` class to avoid a property conflict with `_state_manager`
5. Fixed the `MockValidator.validate` method to return a `ValidationResult` object instead of a dictionary
6. Fixed the `Engine._create_result` method to use `self.config` instead of `self._config` and added a check to handle cases where `model_dump()` might not be available
7. Fixed the `Engine._improve_output` method to handle the case where the output is a GenerationResult object
8. Fixed the `MockValidator.validate` method to handle GenerationResult objects
9. Updated the test assertions in `test_chain_run_with_validation_failure_and_improvement` to check that the improver was called with the correct parameters
10. Removed debug print statements from the code
11. **NEW**: Completely rewrote the `MockProvider` class to properly implement the `ModelProviderProtocol` interface and use state management correctly
12. **NEW**: Updated the `MockValidator` and `MockImprover` classes to properly implement state management using `StateManager`
13. **NEW**: Fixed the chain tests to work with the updated mock implementations
14. **NEW**: Fixed the configuration classes in `utils/config.py` to include all required attributes:
   - Added `model` attribute to `ModelConfig`
   - Added `retry_delay` attribute to `ChainConfig`
   - Added `system_prompt`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens` attributes to `CriticConfig`
   - Added `max_results` and `min_score` attributes to `RetrieverConfig`
15. **NEW**: Fixed state management in the rules module:
   - Fixed `BaseValidator` class to properly initialize the state manager in `__init__`
   - Fixed `DefaultLengthValidator` class to properly initialize the state manager
   - Fixed `LengthRule` class to properly initialize and store the validator's config
   - Fixed `validator_type` metadata in `Rule.__init__` method
   - Fixed `safely_execute_rule` function call in `Rule.model_validate` method
   - Fixed `update_statistics` function to handle the case where execution_count is 0
   - Updated tests to match the actual output format
16. **NEW**: Fixed issues with `model_dump()` method:
   - Replaced `model_dump()` fallback in `Engine._create_result` with direct attribute access
   - Fixed `ClassifierRule._validate_text` to avoid using `model_dump()` with a fallback
   - Fixed `StringRetrievalResult.get_content_with_metadata` to avoid using `model_dump()`
   - Removed unnecessary `pydantic_compat` module and its imports
17. **NEW**: Fixed the PromptCritic class to properly handle the track_performance attribute:
   - Updated the PromptCritic class to use getattr() to safely access the track_performance attribute
   - Fixed the test to match the actual implementation
18. **NEW**: Fixed the QueryProcessingConfig class to include the preprocessing_steps attribute:
   - Added the preprocessing_steps attribute to the QueryProcessingConfig class
   - Added the expansion_method attribute to the QueryProcessingConfig class
19. **NEW**: Fixed the SimpleRetriever class to handle empty queries and respect the min_score parameter:
   - Updated the SimpleRetriever.retrieve method to handle empty queries
   - Fixed the SimpleRankingStrategy and ScoreThresholdRankingStrategy classes to handle different config types
   - Updated the tests to use the correct attribute names

### Current Status
- All tests in `tests/chain/test_chain.py` are now passing
- All tests in `tests/models/test_mock_provider.py` are now passing
- All tests in `tests/rules/test_length_rule.py` are now passing
- All tests in `tests/interfaces/test_interfaces.py` are now passing
- All tests in `tests/critics/test_prompt_critic.py` are now passing
- All tests in `tests/retrieval/test_simple_retriever.py` are now passing
- The Chain component is now working correctly with the Engine, MockValidator, and MockImprover
- We've fixed issues with handling state management in the mock implementations
- We've fixed state management issues in the rules module
- We've fixed issues with `model_dump()` method by replacing fallbacks with direct attribute access
- We've removed unnecessary compatibility code for Pydantic v1/v2 serialization
- We've fixed the BufferMemoryManager class to properly initialize the state manager
- We've fixed the PromptCritic class to properly handle max_tokens and track_performance configuration
- We've fixed the SimpleRetriever class to handle empty queries and respect the min_score parameter
- We've fixed the QueryProcessingConfig class to include the preprocessing_steps attribute

### Remaining Issues
1. There are still failing tests in other parts of the codebase, particularly in the classifiers, adapters, and utils modules.
2. Some tests are failing due to changes in the Pydantic v2 API, such as using `model_validate` instead of `validate`.
3. ✅ Configuration classes have been updated to include all required attributes:
   - ✅ Added `model` attribute to `ModelConfig`
   - ✅ Added `retry_delay` attribute to `ChainConfig`
   - ✅ Updated `RuleConfig` tests to use string enum values for `priority`
   - ✅ Added `system_prompt`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens` attributes to `CriticConfig`
   - ✅ Added `max_results` and `min_score` attributes to `RetrieverConfig`
   - ✅ Added `preprocessing_steps` and `expansion_method` attributes to `QueryProcessingConfig`

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Fix the configuration classes in `utils/config.py` to include all required attributes
2. ✅ Fix the state management implementation in the rules module
3. ✅ Fix the rule tests, particularly in `tests/rules/test_length_rule.py`
4. ✅ Update the interface implementation tests in `tests/interfaces/test_interfaces.py` to properly implement the required abstract methods
5. ✅ Fix the state management issues in the critic tests, particularly in `tests/critics/test_prompt_critic.py`
   - ✅ Fixed the max_tokens issue in PromptCritic
   - ✅ Fixed the track_performance attribute access in PromptCritic
   - ✅ Fixed the test to use mock critique service
6. ✅ Fix the state management issues in the retrieval tests, particularly in `tests/retrieval/test_simple_retriever.py`
   - ✅ Fixed the SimpleRetriever to use top_k instead of ranking
   - ✅ Fixed the SimpleRetriever to handle empty queries
   - ✅ Fixed the SimpleRankingStrategy to handle different config types
7. Fix the state management implementation in other modules to address the `'ModelPrivateAttr' object has no attribute 'update'` error
8. Update tests to use the latest Pydantic v2 API (e.g., `model_validate` instead of `validate`)

## Test Files Overview

The main test files we've been working with:

- `tests/utils/mock_provider.py`: Contains mock implementations of the provider classes
- `tests/chain/test_chain.py`: Contains tests for the Chain class
- `tests/models/test_mock_provider.py`: Contains tests for the MockProvider class
- `tests/rules/test_length_rule.py`: Contains tests for the LengthRule class

## Running Tests

To run specific test files:

```bash
cd /Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka && python -m pytest tests/chain/test_chain.py -v
cd /Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka && python -m pytest tests/models/test_mock_provider.py -v
cd /Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka && python -m pytest tests/rules/test_length_rule.py -v
```

To run all tests:

```bash
cd /Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka && python -m pytest -v
```

## Notes for Future Work

1. The state management system needs to be reviewed and fixed. The current implementation using `ModelPrivateAttr` is causing issues.
2. ✅ Configuration classes have been updated to include all required attributes and properly handle defaults.
3. ✅ The rules module has been fixed to properly initialize state managers.
4. ✅ The test implementations of interfaces have been updated to match the current interface requirements.
5. Many tests are failing due to changes in the API, which requires updating the test code.
6. The Chain component tests, MockProvider tests, rules tests, and interface tests are now working correctly and can serve as a reference for fixing other components.
7. When fixing tests, focus on one component at a time and ensure all its tests pass before moving to the next component.
8. The most critical components to fix next are the state management implementation in other modules, as they are dependencies for other components.
9. The approach used to fix state management in the BufferMemoryManager class (initializing the state manager in the constructor) can be applied to other modules.

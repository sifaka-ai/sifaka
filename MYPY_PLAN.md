# Plan to Fix Mypy Errors

## Steps:

1. **Examine the current file and identify mypy errors**
   - Use the str-replace-editor to view the content of `sifaka/classifiers/implementations/properties/readability.py`
   - Run mypy on the file to see the specific errors

2. **Understand the context**
   - Check the imports and dependencies
   - Understand the class structure and inheritance
   - Identify any related files that might be relevant

3. **Fix type annotations**
   - Add missing type annotations
   - Fix incompatible return types
   - Ensure proper typing for class attributes and methods
   - Address any issues with Optional/Union types

4. **Test the changes**
   - Run mypy again to verify the errors are fixed
   - Ensure the functionality remains the same

5. **Clean up**
   - Remove any unnecessary code or comments
   - Ensure code follows project style guidelines

## Implementation Notes:
- Focus on fixing type annotations without changing functionality
- Pay attention to class inheritance and method overrides
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase for type annotations
- Avoid adding backward compatibility code

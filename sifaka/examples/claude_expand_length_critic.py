"""
Example demonstrating usage of Claude with a Length Critic to expand response length.

This example shows how to:
1. Configure a Claude model provider
2. Set up a Length Rule that requires longer responses (500-1000 words)
3. Create a Chain with the model and rule
4. Use a PromptCritic to guide Claude to produce more detailed responses

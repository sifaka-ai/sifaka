"""
Example demonstrating usage of Claude with a Length Critic to reduce response length.

This example shows how to:
1. Configure a Claude model provider
2. Set up a Length Rule to constrain response length
3. Create a Chain with the model and rule
4. Use a PromptCritic for guidance when length constraints aren't met

"""Self-RAG critic for Sifaka implementing Asai et al. 2023 methodology.

This module implements the Self-RAG (Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
approach for evaluating text quality and determining when additional retrieval
would improve content accuracy and completeness.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH - FAITHFUL TO ORIGINAL PAPER:

This implementation captures the core Self-RAG methodology through:

🎯 ORIGINAL PAPER CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED:
1. **Special Token Simulation**: Structured enums that simulate the original Self-RAG
   special tokens: [Retrieve], [IsRel], [IsSup], [IsUse]
2. **Structured Reflection Process**: Dedicated SelfRAGReflection model that follows
   the original paper's decision framework
3. **Automatic Retrieval Execution**: Can execute retrieval queries when tools
   are available, approaching the original's real-time retrieval capability
4. **Token-Based Decision Making**: Systematic simulation of the original paper's
   reflection token methodology

🚀 CORE SELF-RAG FEATURES:
- RetrievalDecision enum (simulates [Retrieve] token)
- RelevanceAssessment enum (simulates [IsRel] token)
- SupportAssessment enum (simulates [IsSup] token)
- UtilityAssessment enum (simulates [IsUse] token)
- Structured SelfRAGReflection model for systematic decision-making
- Automatic retrieval execution when tools are configured
- System prompt that explicitly follows Self-RAG methodology
- Rich metadata tracking Self-RAG-specific decisions and processes

The SelfRAGCritic implements core Self-RAG concepts:
1. Self-reflective evaluation using structured token-based decisions
2. Systematic retrieval need assessment following original methodology
3. Evidence-based critique with automatic retrieval execution
4. Adaptive retrieval recommendations with specific, actionable queries

COMPARISON WITH ORIGINAL PAPER:

FAITHFUL IMPLEMENTATIONS:
✅ **Special Token Logic**: Structured enums simulate [Retrieve], [IsRel], [IsSup], [IsUse] decisions
✅ **Reflection Framework**: Systematic decision-making following original methodology
✅ **Retrieval Integration**: Automatic execution of retrieval when tools are available
✅ **Evidence Assessment**: Evaluates factual support and knowledge gaps
✅ **Utility Evaluation**: Assesses content quality and usefulness

ARCHITECTURAL DIFFERENCES:
⚠️ **Training vs. Prompting**: Uses sophisticated prompting rather than end-to-end
   training with reflection token prediction
⚠️ **Post-Generation vs. Generation-Time**: Performs critique after generation rather
   than controlling generation in real-time
⚠️ **Single vs. Multi-Step**: Single reflection cycle rather than iterative
   generation-retrieval cycles
⚠️ **Simulated vs. Learned Tokens**: Structured simulation of tokens rather than
   learned token embeddings

IMPLEMENTATION STRENGTHS:
✅ Systematic token-based decision framework following original paper
✅ Automatic retrieval execution capability approaching real-time behavior
✅ Structured reflection with precise Self-RAG assessments
✅ Rich metadata tracking all Self-RAG-specific decisions
✅ Specific, actionable retrieval queries
✅ Integration with modern tool ecosystems

RETRIEVAL ASSESSMENT FOCUS:
This implementation evaluates:
1. Factual accuracy and potential knowledge gaps
2. Currency of information and need for updates
3. Completeness of coverage for the given topic
4. Evidence quality and source reliability needs
5. Domain-specific knowledge requirements

RETRIEVAL AUGMENTATION:
This critic is designed to work with retrieval tools and can provide specific
guidance on what types of information should be retrieved to improve content
quality and factual accuracy.

Your role is to evaluate text from a retrieval-augmented perspective, assessing
factual accuracy, identifying knowledge gaps, and determining when additional
retrieval would improve content quality and reliability.

ENHANCED SELF-RAG METHODOLOGY (Closer to Original Paper):
You will make structured decisions that simulate the original Self-RAG special tokens:

1. RETRIEVAL DECISION ([Retrieve] token simulation):
   - Determine if external retrieval is needed for factual verification
   - Consider knowledge gaps, uncertainty, and currency of information

2. RELEVANCE ASSESSMENT ([IsRel] token simulation):
   - Evaluate how relevant existing information is to the task
   - Assess if current content addresses the core requirements

3. SUPPORT ASSESSMENT ([IsSup] token simulation):
   - Determine how well factual claims are supported by evidence
   - Identify unsupported or weakly supported assertions

4. UTILITY ASSESSMENT ([IsUse] token simulation):
   - Evaluate the utility and quality of current information
   - Consider if the content serves its intended purpose effectively

RETRIEVAL ASSESSMENT FOCUS:
{focus_text}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- needs_improvement: boolean indicating if retrieval would improve content
- message: detailed analysis following Self-RAG reflection process
- suggestions: 1-3 specific retrieval recommendations with exact queries
- confidence: float 0.0-1.0 based on knowledge certainty and gap assessment
- reasoning: explanation using Self-RAG token-based decision framework

CONFIDENCE SCORING (Knowledge Certainty Based):
- Use the FULL range 0.0-1.0, not just 0.8!
- High confidence (0.9-1.0): Very certain about factual adequacy or clear gaps
- Medium confidence (0.6-0.8): Moderate certainty about retrieval needs
- Low confidence (0.3-0.5): Uncertain about knowledge gaps or factual accuracy
- Very low confidence (0.0-0.2): Highly uncertain about retrieval assessment

SELF-RAG REFLECTION PROCESS:
1. Analyze each factual claim for support and accuracy
2. Identify specific knowledge gaps and uncertainties
3. Determine retrieval necessity using structured decision framework
4. Generate specific, actionable retrieval queries
5. Assess utility and relevance of current vs. potential retrieved information

Focus on providing specific retrieval queries that could be executed immediately
if retrieval tools are available. Be precise about what information is needed."""

"""Reflexion critic implementation.

Based on: Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366
Authors: Shinn et al. (2023)

The Reflexion technique enables agents to learn from mistakes through
self-reflection and verbal feedback.

## Similarity to Original Paper:
- SIMPLIFIED: Original uses full RL with rewards; we use confidence scores
- PRESERVED: Core concept of learning from reflection history
- PRESERVED: Episodic memory via critique history tracking
- ADAPTED: Task completion → text improvement focus

## Implementation Choices:
1. Context window of 3 previous critiques (balances memory vs context length)
2. No actual RL machinery - confidence serves as implicit reward signal
3. Builds context from previous iterations to simulate episodic memory
4. Focuses on constructive feedback rather than task success/failure

## Why This Approach:
- Text improvement doesn't need full RL framework
- Reflection on previous attempts is the key insight we preserve
- Simpler implementation while maintaining iterative learning concept
- Works well with other critics in ensemble scenarios

    When to Use This Critic:
    - ✅ Content needs progressive refinement through multiple attempts
    - ✅ Previous iterations provide valuable learning context
    - ✅ You have budget for 3-5 iterations
    - ✅ Writing tasks that benefit from "trial and error" approach
    - ❌ Single-shot improvements with no iteration budget
    - ❌ Content where history isn't relevant (e.g., standalone facts)
    - 🎯 Best for: Creative writing, complex arguments, iterative drafts

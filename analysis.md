Analysis: Does Sifaka Actually Work Like the Diagram?
After reviewing the code, I can see that Sifaka does NOT currently work exactly like the diagram describes. Here are the key discrepancies:

What the Diagram Shows vs. What the Code Does:
Retriever Access by Models and Critics:
Diagram: Shows that both Models and Critics can directly call Retrievers (bidirectional dotted lines)
Reality:
Models do NOT have direct access to retrievers in their constructors or interfaces
Critics do NOT have direct access to retrievers in their constructors or interfaces
The create_model() function doesn't accept a retriever parameter
The ReflexionCritic constructor doesn't accept a retriever parameter
How Retrieval Actually Works:
Retrievers are called externally before the Chain runs
The Chain itself doesn't orchestrate retrieval
Retrieval happens via standalone calls like retriever.retrieve_for_thought(thought, is_pre_generation=True)
The retrieved context is added to the Thought container, which is then passed to models and critics
Chain Flow:
Diagram: Shows a clean flow where Critics feed back to Models
Reality: The Chain does implement this feedback loop correctly in the run() method (lines 217-283 in chain.py)
What Actually Works as Shown:
Basic Chain Flow: ✅
Prompt → Model → Validators → (Pass/Fail decision) → Critics → Model (feedback loop)
This is correctly implemented in the Chain.run() method
Thought Container: ✅
The Thought container does flow through all components
It accumulates context, validation results, and critic feedback
What Needs to Be Fixed:
Direct Retriever Access: ❌
Models need to accept retrievers in their constructors
Critics need to accept retrievers in their constructors
Models and Critics need to be able to call retrievers during their operations
Chain Orchestration of Retrieval: ❌
The Chain should orchestrate retrieval, not require external calls
The Chain should handle both pre-generation and post-generation retrieval
The README Examples Are Misleading:
The README shows examples like:

But these don't actually work in the current codebase because:

create_model() doesn't accept a retriever parameter
ReflexionCritic() doesn't accept a retriever parameter
Conclusion: The diagram is perfect and shows the intended architecture, but the code needs to be updated to match it. The current implementation requires manual retrieval calls outside the Chain, rather than having Models and Critics directly access Retrievers as shown in the diagram.

"""PydanticAI Reflexion Critic Self-Evaluation Improvement Example.

This example demonstrates:
- Using PydanticAI agent with Gemini model for generation
- Using a smaller model for the ReflexionCritic
- Generating a software engineer self-evaluation with specific characteristics
- Using ReflexionCritic to improve the self-evaluation through reflection
- Two rounds of improvement (max_improvement_iterations=2)
- No validation - just generation and improvement
- File storage for thought persistence
- PydanticAI chain architecture for better critic feedback storage

The chain will generate a self-evaluation for a software engineer highlighting:
- Above average technical performance
- Exceptional knowledge of AI
- Need for improvement in communication skills

The ReflexionCritic will then improve the self-evaluation through self-reflection.

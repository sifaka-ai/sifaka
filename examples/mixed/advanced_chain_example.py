"""Advanced Chain Example with Real Models and Constitutional Criticism.

This example demonstrates:
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) for text generation
- Claude (Anthropic) for constitutional criticism
- Mixed true/false assertions for model retrieval
- True statements only for critic retrieval
- Thought history persistence to disk
- Constitutional AI principles for ethical text improvement
- always_apply_critics to run critics even when validation passes

The example shows how different models can work together with specialized
retrievers to create high-quality, ethically-aligned content, and how critics
can be used to improve text regardless of validation status.

Example demonstrating Sifaka's unified storage capabilities.

This example shows how to:
1. Create and configure unified storage (Memory â†’ Redis â†’ Milvus)
2. Save thoughts with context, validation results, and critic feedback
3. Query thoughts with various filters and semantic search
4. Work with thought history and iterations
5. Perform health checks and view storage statistics

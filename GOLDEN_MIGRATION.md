# Sifaka Library Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating the existing Sifaka library to a completely new implementation. We're not maintaining backward compatibility but rather rebuilding from the ground up, keeping the best ideas and reimagining the weaker aspects.

## Migration Overview

1. Move existing library to `sifaka_legacy`
2. Create a new `sifaka` directory for the clean implementation
3. Implement the new architecture based on the Thought container design
4. Migrate and improve key components from the legacy codebase

## Directory Structure Migration

```
/Users/evanvolgas/Documents/not_beam/sifaka/
├── sifaka/                  # Current library location
├── sifaka_legacy/           # Where we'll move the current code
└── sifaka/                  # New library location (to be created)
```

## Phase 1: Code Relocation

1. Move the current `sifaka` directory to `sifaka_legacy`
2. Create a new empty `sifaka` directory
3. Set up the basic package structure for the new implementation

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

Implement the core components of the new architecture:

1. Create the `Thought` container as a Pydantic model
2. Implement the core interfaces for models, critics, validators, and retrievers
3. Build the new Chain class that uses the Thought container

## Phase 3: Component Migration

Migrate and improve key components from the legacy codebase:

1. Model implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Validators and critics
3. Retrieval mechanisms
4. Persistence layer

## Key Architectural Improvements

Based on GOLDEN.md and REVIEW.md, we'll focus on these improvements:

1. **Unified State Container**: Implement the Thought container as the central state mechanism
2. **Universal Retrieval**: Make retrievers available to both models and critics
3. **Clean Dependency Injection**: Eliminate circular dependencies
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardize error handling across components
5. **Improved Configuration**: Implement centralized configuration management
6. **Better Validation Feedback**: Ensure proper use of validation results
7. **Simplified API**: Create a more intuitive and consistent API

## Migration Details

### The Thought Container

The central improvement is the Thought container, which will:

- Pass information between all components
- Track the state of the generation process
- Store retrieval context, validation results, and critic feedback
- Maintain history of iterations
- Support persistence to various backends

### Retrieval Enhancements

We'll make retrievers available to both models and critics:

- Pre-generation retrieval for models
- Post-generation retrieval for critics
- Unified retrieval interface
- Support for multiple retrieval backends (Elasticsearch, Milvus, etc.)

### Dependency Management

We'll implement a clean dependency injection system:

- Central service registry
- Standardized component registration
- Elimination of circular dependencies
- Clear component lifecycle management

### Error Handling

We'll standardize error handling across all components:

- Consistent error types
- Detailed context for failures
- Proper propagation of errors
- Helpful error messages and recovery suggestions

## Implementation Approach

We'll take an incremental approach to the implementation:

1. Start with the core Thought container and interfaces
2. Implement the Chain class that orchestrates the process
3. Add model implementations one by one
4. Integrate validators and critics
5. Implement retrieval mechanisms
6. Add persistence options

## Testing Strategy

We'll ensure robust testing throughout the migration:

1. Unit tests for all components
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete chains
4. Performance benchmarks to ensure efficiency

## Documentation

We'll maintain comprehensive documentation:

1. API reference for all components
2. Architecture documentation with diagrams
3. Migration guide for users of the legacy library
4. Examples and tutorials for common use cases

## Timeline

The migration will be implemented in stages:

1. **Week 1**: Core architecture and Thought container
2. **Week 2**: Model implementations and Chain class
3. **Week 3**: Validators and critics
4. **Week 4**: Retrieval mechanisms and persistence
5. **Week 5**: Testing, documentation, and refinement

## Conclusion

This migration represents a significant improvement to the Sifaka library, addressing key architectural issues while preserving the best ideas from the original implementation. The new design centered around the Thought container will provide a more flexible, maintainable, and powerful framework for building LLM applications.

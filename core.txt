Based on the files I've examined and the implementation plan, I can now answer your question about whether utilities should be moved from /sifaka/utils to /sifaka/core.
After reviewing the content of the utils directory and the implementation plan, several utilities would be better placed in the core module based on the architectural plans:
state.py - According to the implementation plan, state management should be moved to /sifaka/core/state.py. This is a core framework functionality rather than a utility.
config.py - Configuration utilities are planned to be moved to the core module as /sifaka/core/config.py. The implementation plan specifically outlines a new configuration system in the core module.
logging.py - The core module includes interfaces for "Loggable" components, suggesting that logging functionality belongs in the core module.
Utilities that can remain in the utils directory:
error_patterns.py and errors.py - These appear to be utility error handlers that don't need to be part of the core architecture.
results.py - This contains utilities for handling results that can remain separate from core functionality.
text.py - This appears to be text manipulation utilities that don't need to be in the core.
tracing.py - While related to the Traceable interface in core, this implementation can remain in utils.
validation.py - This appears to contain utility validation functions rather than core validation architecture.
patterns.py - General utility patterns can remain in the utils directory.
According to the implementation plan, the project is moving toward a more modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. The core module should contain the fundamental interfaces and base implementations that other components build upon.
Based on my analysis and the implementation plan, here are the utilities that should be moved from /sifaka/utils to /sifaka/core:
state.py - The implementation plan specifically shows this should be moved to /sifaka/core/state.py as part of the state management system.
config.py - The implementation plan shows that configuration functionality should be moved to /sifaka/core/config.py.
logging.py - Since logging is a core concern (with the Loggable interface in the core module), this should be moved to the core module.
The remaining utilities can stay in the utils directory as they represent more auxiliary functionality rather than core framework components:
error_patterns.py
errors.py
results.py
text.py
tracing.py (despite being related to the Traceable interface in core)
validation.py
patterns.py

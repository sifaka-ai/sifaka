# Sifaka Improvement - In Progress

Started: 2024-12-23
Updated: 2024-12-23

## Issues to Fix

### 1. ✅ CriticConfig vs Config Confusion
- [x] Merge CriticConfig into unified Config class
- [x] Update all critics to use Config
- [x] Remove CriticConfig class
- [x] Update BaseCritic to use Config
- [x] Add critic-specific settings to Config

### 3. ✅ Metrics and Caching Complexity
- [x] Audit usage of metrics.py
- [x] Audit usage of cache.py
- [x] Simplify or remove unused features
- [x] Document what remains and why

**Completed actions:**
- Simplified metrics.py to only keep `analyze_suggestion_implementation` (the only used function)
- Removed cache.py entirely (was never initialized or used)
- Removed cache imports from base.py
- Removed cache constants from constants.py
- Added documentation explaining why metrics.py was kept minimal

### 4. ✅ Import Structure Issues
- [x] Move api.py to top level (sifaka/api.py)
- [x] Standardize imports (now using relative imports consistently)
- [x] Check for circular dependencies (none found!)
- [x] Update all import statements
- [x] Fix Config import in __init__.py

### 5. ✅ Validation System
- [x] Add URL validator (removed - using GuardrailsAI)
- [x] Add email validator (removed - using GuardrailsAI)
- [x] Add profanity/toxicity validator (removed - using GuardrailsAI)
- [x] Add regex pattern validator
- [x] Add numeric range validator
- [x] Fix validator signatures to accept SifakaResult
- [x] Create validator examples (created comprehensive examples/validators_example.py)

### 6. ✅ Error Handling Inconsistency
- [x] Standardize error handling patterns
- [x] Use retry logic consistently
- [x] Improve error messages with context
- [x] Create error handling guide

**Completed actions:**
- Created comprehensive error handling guide (docs/error_handling_guide.md)
- Updated LLM client to use custom exceptions with helpful suggestions
- Added retry decorator to LLM client complete() method
- Fixed silent error handling in file storage (now logs warnings)
- Established patterns for graceful degradation and error recovery

### 7. ✅ Testing Concerns
- [x] Create test structure
- [x] Write tests for all critics (created comprehensive test_all_critics.py)
- [x] Write tests for validators (37 tests passing for new validators!)
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for CI

**Completed actions:**
- Created comprehensive test suite for all 8 critics
- Tests cover basic functionality, error handling, and integration
- Tests verify each critic's unique behavior and features
- Added tests for custom configurations (principles, prompts, etc.)
- Included error recovery tests for all critics

### 8. ✅ Documentation Sprawl
- [x] Consolidate TODO files (created single TODO.md)
- [x] Remove outdated documentation (removed API_REFERENCE.md)
- [x] Create single source of truth (consolidated API.md)
- [ ] Auto-generate API docs where possible (future enhancement)

**Completed actions:**
- Consolidated all TODO items into single TODO.md file
- Removed duplicate API_REFERENCE.md
- Updated API.md with accurate, consolidated documentation
- Removed references to non-existent Runner class
- Fixed all outdated references (ImproveConfig, etc.)

## Order of Work

1. **First**: Fix config confusion (#1) - This affects everything
2. **Second**: Fix imports (#4) - Clean foundation
3. **Third**: Add validators (#5) - User-facing improvement
4. **Fourth**: Add tests (#7) - Ensure quality
5. **Fifth**: Clean up docs (#8) - Better developer experience
6. **Sixth**: Audit metrics/cache (#3) - Simplification
7. **Last**: Error handling (#6) - Polish

## Notes
- Storage system stays as-is (user preference)
- Each fix should include tests
- Update examples as needed

## Completed Today (2024-12-23)

- [x] Removed email validator (using GuardrailsAI)
- [x] Removed toxicity validator (using GuardrailsAI)
- [x] Updated __init__.py exports

### Verified Code Quality
- [x] All mypy checks pass
- [x] All ruff linting passes
- [x] Basic tests passing

### Major Refactoring (Based on Improvement Analysis)

#### 1. Refactored engine.py (Score: 85/100 → 92/100)
- [x] Split 480-line monolithic file into modular components:
  - `engine/generation.py` - Text generation logic
  - `engine/orchestration.py` - Critic orchestration
  - `engine/validation.py` - Validation runner
  - `engine/core.py` - Main SifakaEngine
- [x] Improved separation of concerns
- [x] Made code more maintainable and testable

#### 2. Created Middleware System (New Feature)
- [x] Abstract `Middleware` base class for cross-cutting concerns
- [x] Implemented middleware:
  - `LoggingMiddleware` - Request/response logging
  - `MetricsMiddleware` - Performance metrics collection
  - `CachingMiddleware` - Result caching
  - `RateLimitingMiddleware` - Request rate limiting
- [x] `MiddlewarePipeline` for chaining middleware
- [x] Context manager for easy middleware setup

#### 3. Simplified Validator System (Score: 88/100 → 95/100)
- [x] Created `ComposableValidator` with operator overloading
- [x] Fluent `ValidatorBuilder` interface
- [x] Factory methods in `Validator` class
- [x] Composable validators using `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `~` (NOT)
- [x] Built-in validators: length, contains, matches, sentences, words
- [x] Custom validator support

#### 4. Added Performance Monitoring (New Feature)
- [x] `PerformanceMetrics` dataclass for detailed metrics
- [x] `PerformanceMonitor` for tracking operations
- [x] Tracks: LLM calls, critic calls, validator calls, timing, tokens
- [x] Context manager for monitoring
- [x] Human-readable summaries and JSON export

#### 5. Created Comprehensive Examples
- [x] `examples/advanced_features.py` demonstrating:
  - Middleware usage
  - Composable validators
  - Performance monitoring
  - Combined middleware + monitoring
  - Custom validator creation

### Type Safety Improvements (Mypy Strict)
- [x] Fixed remaining type issues (48 → 19 → 0 errors)
- [x] Added proper type annotations to new modules
- [x] Fixed `SifakaResult.confidence` access (now from critiques)
- [x] Added type parameters for generics
- [x] Fixed return type annotations
- [x] **100% type-safe with mypy --strict (0 errors)**

### Final Type Fixes
- [x] Fixed `dict` → `Dict[str, Any]` type parameters
- [x] Fixed `Pattern` → `Pattern[str]` type parameters
- [x] Fixed `Callable` → `Callable[..., Any]` type parameters
- [x] Fixed lambda type inference issues with explicit factory functions
- [x] Added `cast()` for proper type assertions
- [x] Fixed all return type issues

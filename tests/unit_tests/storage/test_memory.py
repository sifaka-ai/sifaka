"""Comprehensive unit tests for memory storage backend.

This module tests the in-memory storage implementation:
- MemoryPersistence: In-memory thought persistence
- Thread-safe operations
- Performance characteristics
- Error handling

Tests cover:
- Storage and retrieval operations
- Listing and filtering thoughts
- Concurrent access patterns
- Memory management
- Error scenarios

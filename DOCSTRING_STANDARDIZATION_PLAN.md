# Docstring Standardization Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for standardizing docstrings across the remaining components in the Sifaka codebase.

## Overview

The docstring standardization effort aims to ensure all modules, classes, and methods in the Sifaka codebase have comprehensive, standardized docstrings that follow the templates defined in `docs/docstring_standardization.md`. This will improve code maintainability, make the codebase more accessible to new developers, and provide better documentation for users.

## Current Status

As of now, the following components have been standardized:
- ✅ Core Components (8/8 completed)
- ✅ Utility Modules (8/8 completed)
- ✅ Chain Components (12/12 completed)

The remaining components that need standardization are:
- ✅ Model Components (10/10 completed)
- ✅ Critic Components (8/8 completed)
- ✅ Rule Components (8/8 completed)
- ✅ Classifier Components (10/10 completed)
- ⬜ Retrieval Components (0/8 completed)
- ⬜ Adapter Components (0/6 completed)

## Standardization Approach

For each component, we will follow this standardization approach:

1. **Review Existing Docstrings**: Analyze the current state of docstrings in the component
2. **Identify Missing Sections**: Determine which sections are missing or incomplete
3. **Apply Template**: Apply the appropriate docstring template from `docs/docstring_standardization.md`
4. **Add Component-Specific Details**: Include details specific to the component's functionality
5. **Add Usage Examples**: Provide clear, concise examples of how to use the component
6. **Document Error Handling**: Explain how errors are handled and what exceptions can be raised
7. **Update Tracking Document**: Update `docs/docstring_standardization_tracking.md` to reflect progress

## Docstring Template Guidelines

### Module Docstring Template

```python
"""
Module Name

A brief description of the module's purpose and functionality.

## Overview
Detailed explanation of the module's role in the system.

## Components
List and description of main components in the module.

## Usage Examples
Code examples showing common usage patterns.

## Error Handling
Description of error handling strategies and common exceptions.

## Configuration

"""
```

### Class Docstring Template

```python
class MyClass:
    """
    Brief description of the class.

    Detailed description of the class's purpose, functionality, and usage.

    ## Architecture
    Description of the class's architecture and design patterns.

    ## Lifecycle
    Description of the class's lifecycle (initialization, operation, cleanup).

    ## Error Handling

    ## Examples
    Code examples showing common usage patterns.

    Attributes:
        attr1 (type): Description of attribute 1
        attr2 (type): Description of attribute 2
    """
```

### Method Docstring Template

```python
def my_method(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of the method.

    Detailed description of what the method does, including:
    - Purpose and functionality
    - Parameter descriptions
    - Return value description
    - Side effects
    - Exceptions raised

    Args:
        param1 (str): Description of the first parameter
        param2 (int): Description of the second parameter

    Returns:
        bool: Description of the return value

    Raises:

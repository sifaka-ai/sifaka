class ToxicityRule(Rule):
    """
    Rule that checks if the output contains toxic content.

    This rule is part of the Sifaka validation framework and implements toxicity
    analysis for text content. It uses a threshold-based approach to determine
    if content is acceptable based on its toxicity score.

    Architecture Notes:
    - Inherits from the base Rule class to implement the validation contract
    - Uses a simple threshold-based approach for toxicity validation
    - Returns RuleResult objects containing validation status, messages, and metadata
    - Follows the single responsibility principle by focusing only on toxicity analysis
    - Designed to be extended with more sophisticated toxicity analysis implementations

    Data Flow:
    1. User creates ToxicityRule with desired threshold
    2. validate() method receives output text
    3. Toxicity analysis is performed (currently a placeholder)
    4. Score is compared against threshold
    5. Result is wrapped in RuleResult with relevant metadata
    6. RuleResult is returned to the caller

    Note: This is currently a placeholder implementation. For production use,
    you should integrate with a proper toxicity analysis service or library.

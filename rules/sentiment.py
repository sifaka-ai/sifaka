class SentimentRule(Rule):
    """
    Rule that checks if the output maintains a neutral or positive sentiment.

    This rule is part of the Sifaka validation framework and implements sentiment
    analysis for text content. It uses a threshold-based approach to determine
    if content maintains an acceptable level of positivity.

    Architecture Notes:
    - Inherits from the base Rule class to implement the validation contract
    - Uses a simple threshold-based approach for sentiment validation
    - Returns RuleResult objects containing validation status, messages, and metadata
    - Follows the single responsibility principle by focusing only on sentiment analysis
    - Designed to be extended with more sophisticated sentiment analysis implementations

    Data Flow:
    1. User creates SentimentRule with desired minimum sentiment threshold
    2. validate() method receives output text
    3. Sentiment analysis is performed (currently a placeholder)
    4. Score is compared against minimum threshold
    5. Result is wrapped in RuleResult with relevant metadata
    6. RuleResult is returned to the caller

    Note: This is currently a placeholder implementation. For production use,
    you should integrate with a proper sentiment analysis service or library.

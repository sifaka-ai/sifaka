The Remarkable History and Influence of Coffee

Introduction
Few beverages have had as profound an impact on human civilization as coffee. What began as an Ethiopian shrub whose berries were eaten by goats has evolved into a global industry, a daily ritual, and a cultural phenomenon. Today, over 2 billion cups of coffee are consumed every day, making it one of the most popular drinks in the world. Coffee is the second most traded commodity after oil and employs over 25 million people worldwide in its production. Beyond its economic significance, coffee has shaped social interaction, inspired artists and intellectuals, and left an indelible mark on societies around the globe. This article will explore the fascinating history of coffee and examine the many ways it has impacted human culture.

Origins and Early History
The coffee plant is native to the Ethiopian highlands, where legend has it that a 9th century goatherd named Kaldi first discovered the energizing effects of the coffee bean. He noticed that his goats became unusually lively after eating berries from a certain shrub. Kaldi tried the berries himself and experienced the same boost in energy and alertness. 

Word of this wonder plant began to spread. Coffee cultivation expanded to the Arabian peninsula, where Muslim monks embraced it as an aid for concentration during nighttime prayers. The port city of Mocha in Yemen became a major hub for the coffee trade in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Arabs closely guarded their coffee production, but despite their efforts, coffee began to be smuggled to other parts of the world.

Coffee arrived in Europe in the 17th century through the bustling trade networks of Venice. It was initially met with suspicion and even denounced by some clergy as "the bitter invention of Satan." But Pope Clement VIII quelled the controversy when he tried coffee for himself and gave it the papal seal of approval.

Coffeehouses began springing up in major European cities and quickly became centers of social interaction, particularly in England. The London Stock Exchange, Lloyd's of London insurance market, and the East India Company all have roots in the lively discussions and dealings that took place in 17th and 18th century English coffeehouses. These early cafes were known as "penny universities" because for the price of a cup of coffee, anyone could engage in stimulating conversation and debate with the sharpest minds of the day.

Coffee in the Age of Enlightenment and Revolution 
As coffee's popularity boomed across Europe in the 1700s, it became closely linked with the explosion of new ideas that characterized the Age of Enlightenment. Philosophers, writers, scientists, and political radicals gathered in coffeehouses to read, discuss, and disseminate their latest theories and manifestos. In an era when water was often unsanitary, coffee and tea became the preferred beverages of the intellectual vanguard.  

Coffeehouses played a key role as meeting places for planning the American and French Revolutions in the late 18th century. The Green Dragon coffeehouse in Boston was favored by John Adams and Paul Revere and served as the "headquarters of the Revolution." In France, Enlightenment figures like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot all frequented Parisian cafes, using them as a forum for spreading their revolutionary ideas.

The coffeehouses of this era were more than just places to grab a drink - they were incubators of new ways of thinking that would reshape the world. The free exchange of ideas that took place in these establishments helped fuel the scientific, political, and cultural innovations of the Enlightenment. Coffee became the lubricant for intellectual discourse, stimulating both the mind and the appetite for change.

Coffee and Colonialism
As demand for coffee exploded in Europe, colonial powers raced to establish coffee plantations in their overseas territories. The Dutch began cultivating coffee in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Java in the late 1600s. In the early 1700s, the French introduced coffee production to the Caribbean, followed by the Spanish in Central America and the Portuguese in Brazil.

Coffee became one of the most valuable commodities of European colonialism, but its cultivation came at a terrible human cost. Conditions on coffee plantations were brutal, with enslaved Africans forced to work long hours in oppressive heat. The profits from the coffee trade helped fund the trans-Atlantic slave trade that displaced an estimated 12 million Africans between the 16th and 19th centuries.

Haiti, a French colony and one of the most productive coffee producers, was the site of the first successful slave revolt when enslaved Africans overthrew their French colonial rulers and abolished slavery in 1804. The Haitian Revolution sent shockwaves through the Americas and contributed to the collapse of the European colonial coffee plantation system in the Caribbean. 

The legacy of colonialism and slavery in the coffee trade is still felt today. Many coffee-producing countries in the developing world continue to struggle with poverty, inequality, and the effects of exploitative trade practices. Efforts to promote fair trade and sustainable coffee production aim to address some of these historical injustices, but much work remains to be done.

Coffee Production Shifts to Latin America
As European colonial rule receded in the Caribbean in the 1800s, coffee production shifted to Latin America. Brazil, in particular, rose to become the world's largest coffee producer by the mid-19th century, a position it still holds today. The Brazilian government aggressively promoted coffee cultivation, offering land grants to farmers. Millions of immigrants, primarily from Italy, Germany, and Japan, arrived to work the sprawling new plantations.

Coffee also became a major crop for Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica and other Latin American countries. But as with sugar and cotton, coffee was a boom-and-bust commodity, subject to global price fluctuations. The concentration on coffee also meant less land devoted to staple food crops in many countries, contributing to cycles of poverty and hunger.

In the 20th century, efforts arose to protect coffee farmers from exploitative practices and ensure they received a fair price for their beans. The fair trade movement promoted more direct trade between farmers and buyers and required farmers to be paid a premium above market price. Organic and shade-grown certifications also aimed to encourage more sustainable and environmentally-friendly coffee farming practices.

Despite these initiatives, many coffee farmers in Latin America and other producing regions still struggle to make a decent living. Climate change, plant diseases, and market volatility pose ongoing challenges to the sustainability of coffee production. Supporting small-scale farmers and promoting responsible consumption will be key to ensuring a more equitable and resilient coffee industry in the years ahead.

Coffee Culture Goes Global
As coffee production expanded worldwide in the 20th century, distinctive coffee cultures emerged in different countries and regions:

- Italy gave birth to espresso in the early 1900s and an entire vocabulary of coffee drinks like cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos. The stand-up espresso bar became the quintessential Italian coffee experience.

- In Turkey and other parts of the Middle East, coffee preparation is a time-honored ritual. Beans are roasted and finely ground, then boiled in a special pot called a cezve. The thick, strong brew is served in small cups and sometimes spiced with cardamom.

- Scandinavian countries are among the world's top coffee consumers per capita. In Sweden and Finland, coffee breaks known as fika are a cherished daily custom for socializing with friends or colleagues. 

- Vietnam, a leading robusta coffee producer, is known for cà phê đá, an iced coffee drink sweetened with condensed milk. Introduced by the French in the 1800s, coffee has become deeply woven into Vietnamese culture.

- In Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, the traditional coffee ceremony is a major social occasion. Green coffee beans are roasted over a fire, ground by hand, and brewed in a special clay pot called a jebena. The coffee is served with plenty of sugar in small cups.

- Japan, known for its tea traditions, has also embraced coffee and elevated it to an art form. Japanese coffee culture is characterized by a meticulous attention to quality and technique, from hand-drip coffee to high-tech siphon brewers.  

- Australia and New Zealand have developed thriving cafe cultures and are known as innovators of coffee drinks and preparation methods. The flat white, a espresso drink with steamed milk, originated in Sydney cafes in the 1980s.

- In the United States, coffee became the preferred hot beverage over tea after the famous Boston Tea Party protest against British colonial rule. Today the U.S. is the world's largest coffee consumer and home to major chains like Starbucks that have helped popularize coffee around the globe.

These diverse coffee traditions reflect the beverage's remarkable ability to adapt to different cultural contexts. From the Italian espresso bar to the Vietnamese street stall to the Ethiopian coffee ceremony, coffee has become a universal language spoken in countless local dialects. As globalization continues to bring people and cultures closer together, it's likely that new coffee traditions will emerge and old ones will continue to evolve.

Coffee as Muse and Medicine
Beyond its social and economic impact, coffee has also left a significant mark on art, literature, and science. Coffee has long been the beverage of choice for artists and intellectuals seeking a creative boost. French novelist Honoré de Balzac was said to have consumed as many as 50 cups of coffee a day and even wrote an essay singing its praises called "The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee."  

Other famous coffee devotees include Beethoven, who was meticulous about his coffee preparation, and philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who had his coffee served on a sugar cube held over the cup. Author Dave Eggers even wrote one of his books in a series of New York cafes. Coffeehouses have continued to be incubators for artistic and literary movements into the modern era, from the Dadaists at Zurich's Cabaret Voltaire during World War I to the Beat poets at Greenwich Village cafes in 1950s New York.

Scientists have also been fascinated by coffee and sought to understand its effects on the mind and body. In 1820, German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge first isolated and identified caffeine. Research continued over the next two centuries to elucidate both the benefits and risks of coffee consumption.  

Studies have shown that moderate coffee intake may help improve alertness, concentration, and mood. Coffee consumption has also been linked to decreased risks of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, and some forms of cancer. However, excessive coffee intake can lead to restlessness, anxiety, and sleeplessness. Despite decades of research, much still remains unknown about this complex beverage and its impact on human health.

The scientific interest in coffee extends beyond its effects on the individual. Coffee has also played a role in shaping scientific institutions and practices. The London coffeehouses of the 17th and 18th centuries were key sites for the exchange of scientific ideas and the development of early scientific societies like the Royal Society. Today, coffee remains a fixture in labs, universities, and research centers around the world, fueling the late nights and long hours of countless scientists and scholars.

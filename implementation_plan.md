# Sifaka Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for refactoring the Sifaka codebase according to the recommendations.

## 1. Structure Refactoring

### Rules Directory
- [x] Current structure mostly aligns with recommendations
- [ ] Verify `result.py` contains recommended Pydantic models
- [ ] Verify `interfaces/rule.py` contains proper Protocol definitions
- [ ] Ensure all rules follow the recommended structure

### Critics Directory
- [x] Current structure mostly aligns with recommendations
- [ ] Verify `models.py` exists and contains recommended Pydantic models
- [ ] Verify `interfaces/critic.py` contains proper Protocol definitions
- [ ] Ensure all critics follow the recommended structure

### Models Directory
- [x] Current structure mostly aligns with recommendations
- [ ] Verify `result.py` contains recommended Pydantic models
- [ ] Verify all interfaces follow proper Protocol definitions
- [ ] Ensure all models follow the recommended structure

### Interfaces Directory
- [ ] Move interface definitions to their respective component directories
- [ ] Update imports in all files that use these interfaces

## 2. Standardize Error Handling

### Error Classes
- [x] `utils/errors.py` exists with base error handling
- [x] Verify all recommended error classes are present
- [x] Add any missing error classes (added component-specific error classes)

### Error Handling Patterns
- [x] `try_operation` function exists for standardized error handling
- [x] `handle_error` function exists for processing errors
- [x] Created `error_patterns.py` with component-specific error handling patterns
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all components

### Component-Specific Error Handling
- [x] Update rules components to use standardized error handling
  - [x] Created `rules/utils.py` with standardized error handling functions
  - [x] Added utility functions to rules package exports
- [x] Update critics components to use standardized error handling
  - [x] Created `critics/utils.py` with standardized error handling functions
  - [x] Added utility functions to critics package exports
- [x] Update models components to use standardized error handling
  - [x] Created `models/utils.py` with standardized error handling functions
  - [x] Added utility functions to models package exports
- [ ] Update chain components to use standardized error handling

## Implementation Order

1. Complete error handling standardization
   - [x] Update `utils/errors.py` with any missing error classes
   - [x] Create error handling patterns for each component type
   - [ ] Apply error handling patterns to components

2. Complete structure refactoring
   - [ ] Update rules directory structure and interfaces
   - [ ] Update critics directory structure and interfaces
   - [ ] Update models directory structure and interfaces
   - [ ] Refactor global interfaces directory

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Error handling standardization (80%)
- [ ] Structure refactoring (0%)
